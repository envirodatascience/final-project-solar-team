# Solar Team : Energy Equity through the Lens of Energy Burden and Solar Potential #

## Background:


As the U.S. transitions toward a cleaner energy future, concerns about equity remain front and center. 
Low-income and marginalized communities often face higher energy burdensâ€”spending a greater share of their income on basic energy needs. 
At the same time, many of these communities also sit in areas with strong solar potential. However, the benefits of residential solar adoption are often skewed toward wealthier, whiter households.
This project explores these disparities to better understand where opportunity and inequity intersect.



## Research Questions:


Across U.S. states, how does energy burden compare with residential rooftop solar potential?

Are there states where both burden and potential are high?

Within selected states, how do county-level patterns of energy burden, rooftop solar potential, income, and race align? 

Do areas with the most solar opportunity also face the greatest affordability and racial equity challenges

*Solar Pv data:*
Solar potential as the amount of solar energy that a location can receive and convert into electricity through Solar Photovoltaic( Solar PV) technology.

*Energy burden data:*

The dataset used describes energy burden as share of income spent on basic energy needs
