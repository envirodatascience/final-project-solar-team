## **1.1 Project Overview**

**Title:**
Energy Equity Through the Lens of Energy Burden and Solar Potential

<br>

**Background:**
As the U.S. transitions toward a cleaner energy future, concerns about equity remain front and center. Low-income and marginalized communities often face higher energy burdens—spending a greater share of their income on basic energy needs. At the same time, many of these communities also sit in areas with strong solar potential. However, the benefits of residential solar adoption are often skewed toward wealthier, whiter households.

This project explores where opportunity and inequity intersect, using both energy burden and technical solar potential, as well as demographic and economic factors. By combining traditional metrics with clustering and spatial analysis, the project aims to identify where clean energy investments could be most impactful — and where equity concerns are most urgent.

**Research Questions:**
1. Across U.S. states, how does energy burden compare with residential rooftop solar potential? Are there states where both burden and potential are high?
2. Within selected states, how do county-level patterns of energy burden, rooftop solar potential, income, and race align? Do areas with the most solar opportunity also face the greatest affordability and racial equity challenges?
3. Can clustering counties based on these variables reveal meaningful groups for policy and investment targeting?
And do counties with similar profiles geographically cluster together?

**The notebook has four main sections:**
1.   Introduction
2.   National-level Analysis
3.   County-level Analysis
4.   Conclusion

The two core sections (2 and 3) follow the workflow:
